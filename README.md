Style Enhancer
==============

*Style Enhancer* is an OpenOffice and LibreOffice extension to manage, update and normalize a Writer document’s styles.

It is currently in the early stages of development. There is currently no OXT extension; development happens in an OpenDocument Text document, which also serves as a development report and testing ground for the extension’s modules and functions. You could say that this is a form of “literate programming”!

For information about the extension itself and also about OpenDocument and its main implementations, see the Wiki.
